# VFX Graph:

# An Explosion of Possibilities

## Background Context

This project will be covering basic VFX tutorials and me learning how to use the Visual Effects Graph. I'll be creating fireworks, fireworks that display icons, a mouse cursor effect, a campfire, and a goo effect that splashes onto surfaces.

### Basic Firework

As the entryway to Unity’s Visual Effects Graph, your task isn’t merely to dabble; it’s to absorb the first brushstrokes of digital fireworks artistry. This project will be the creation of a basic firework.

### Red, White, and Boom

Take your foundational knowledge from Task 0 and elevate it into a celebration of freedom. I'll be creating 3 different fireworks that display company logos as the explosion effect.

### Mouse Fireball
This project will be a fireball effect that follows the cursor. It will display a head, tail and sparkles. Super flashy!!

### Fireplace
This project will display a fire with a smoke trail that is impacted by wind! The wind component will be adjustable.

### Goo Blob
This project features a big glob of goo that is spinning out of control flinging the blobs everywhere. Where the blobs collide should leave behind a gooey mess!
